### Pyramid Explorer ###

Small video game created during Ludum Dare 36. The theme for LD36 was **Ancient Technology**. The entire game was created over the course of 72 hours. The whole process was also streamed live on Twitch at twitch.tv/grimelios.

The game takes place inside a large procedurally-generated pyramid. You play as an archeologist searching the pyramid for three pieces of an ancient artifact. To move around, your player can run, jump, or use a grappling hook with a rope attached. Once the grappling hook sticks into a wall, you can swing side to side on the rope or climb up and down.
