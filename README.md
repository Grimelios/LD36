### Pyramid Explorer ###

Created by Mark Hatfield (Grimelios).

This repository holds code and assets for Pyramid Explorer, a game I created during Ludum Dare 36 over the course of 72 hours (minus breaks and sleeping and work). LD36's theme was Ancient Technology. The game's very simple, but I consider it pretty much complete for what I was able to accomplish during the game jam.

The game takes place inside a large procedurally-generated pyramid. You play as an archeologist searching the pyramid for three pieces of an ancient artifact. To move around, your player can run, jump, or use a grappling hook with a rope attached. Once the grappling hook sticks into a wall, you can swing side to side on the rope or climb up and down.

This is the first completed game I've ever been proud of. I'm likely going to continue it offline in a different repository (a private one). Maybe I'll still stream development occasionally. But I wanted to make this code available as it existed at the end of the jam.

If you want to talk to me about anything (feedback, criticism, suggestions, just to chat), the best place to reach me is probably on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Grimelios) (click the word Twitter). Good luck :)
